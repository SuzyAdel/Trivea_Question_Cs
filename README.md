AAST Advanced Programming Project: ArrayList Implementation

This project focuses on implementing an ArrayList from scratch, incorporating basic functions such as add, delete, find, and update.
The primary goal is to provide a hands-on understanding of ArrayList functionality.

## Features

2. **Random Answers:**
   - Generate random answers starting from index 2, as there are four options (correct answer, and three code-generated alternatives: itself, -1, -2).
